        <p>i am currently a student at the great "maseno university" taking pure mathematics and computer science. the two disciplines sprinkle junks of flavourable salt to my graphic design journey as they open my creativity to infinity. i actively take part in clubs and societies where i gain lots of collaboration skills and team working. im in so much love with MUCISA an association that has made this my portfolio dream come true.
